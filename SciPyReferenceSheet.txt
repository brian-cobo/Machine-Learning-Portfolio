1 Sample T Test
    When you perform a t-test, you're usually trying to find evidence of a significant difference between population means (2-sample t) or between the population mean and a hypothesized value (1-sample t). The t-value measures the size of the difference relative to the variation in your sample data.

    from scipy.stats import ttest_1samp
    tstat, pval = ttest_1samp(example_distribution, expected_mean)

2 Sample T Test 
    from scipy.stats import ttest_ind
    tstat, pval = ttest_ind(distribution1, distribution2)

ANOVA Test (Analysis of Variance)
    Compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other.

    from scipy.stats import f_oneway
    fstat, pval = f_oneway(dataset1, dataset2, dataset3)

Tukey Range Test
    Determines which means amongst a set of means differ from the rest.

    from statsmodels.stats.multicomp import pairwise_tukeyhsd
    tukey_results = pairwise_tukeyhsd(dataset1, dataset2, significance_level)

Binomial Test
    A Binomial Test compares a categorical dataset to some expectation. The null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the observed behavior and the expected behavior. If we get a p-value of less than 0.05, we can reject that hypothesis and determine that there is a difference between the observation and expectation.
