Linear Regression
    Goal: Find the slope and intercept pair that minimizes loss on average        across all data
    Examples:
        Predicting cost of a house given market price vs. square footage
        Predicting Tax rate of a contry v its GDP
    Equation: y = mx + b
    Calculate Error: Sum of (y-ypredicted)^2
    To use: 
        from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
        variable = LinearRegression()
        variable.fit(X, y)
        predicted = variable.predict(X)


Vocab to know:
    Gradient Descent: Moving towards the point of the slope that decreases                    loss the most
    Convergence: When the loss stops changing, or slows down tremendously
